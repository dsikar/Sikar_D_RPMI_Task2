end-to-end approach

The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary processing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human steering angle
as the training signal.

Compared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking detection, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all processing
steps simultaneously.

Prior to the widespread adoption of CNNs,
most pattern recognition tasks were performed using an initial stage of hand-crafted feature extraction followed by a classifier.

Network Architecture  

The NVIDIA team claim to have implemented an architecture which others
However this guy

https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-self-driving-cars-7f198ef4cfa2

says he could not do it, but relied on this code:

Supplied by this other guy

So basically, adapted NVIDIA model, tweaked to work with Udacity car simulator.
