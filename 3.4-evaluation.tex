\subsection{Evaluation}

Developing the evaluation metric is part of this project. We are specifically interested in the steering aspect, and how much error (oversteering or understeering) would define an accident.

The initial step is to, once the networks have been trained and tested on our original "dry" data, obtain a ground truth, where no accidents (autonomous vehicles driving off the road) are registered. We will then use our "rainy" image sequences, plus augmented data edited in, and replacing original "dry" data. The expectation is that at a given threshold of added rainy and augmented data, the autonomous network under test will output steering angles for a sufficient amount of frames that would cause the car to go off the road.

Once a few of these cases have been identified for our baseline model, the sequences will be used for all networks, and an evaluation made which should answer our research question.
