\subsection{Literature Survey}

We have trialed, as suggested in class (RMPI 373), reference management tools such as Mendeley and Zotero. Zotero seemed the more user friendly but still we did not fully adapt to the workflow, instead relying on our document layout bibliography file as our reference manager. We understand this situation is not ideal as reference management is expected to become quite complex, so have budgeted time to seek a permanent solution.  

We have conducted the initial literature survey using Google searches that usually led to the required publication. When we could not access an article, we used the library website and were generally able to access articles via institutional login. We obtained a number of texts for our initial literature review. A wider search is required to understand the scope of research in three key areas, Convolutional Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Computer Vision, and Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision applied to sequence learning, as we are ultimately analysing sequences of images. In our Gantt chart (Figure ref gantt) We have set time aside to continue our literature survey.  

By concluding this step, we expect to have a list of conferences, publications, books and source code that will, in addition to our supervisor, guide our work.
