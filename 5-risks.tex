\section{Risks} 
\label{risks}

To generate our risk register (Table \ref{table:risk_table}), as suggested in \cite{Dawson:2009:PCI:1611433} we use: 
\begin{equation}
I = L * C
\end{equation}

where Likelihood $L$ is categorized according to three-point scale 
Low/Medium/High, Consequence $C$ according to five-point
scale Very Low/Low/Medium/High/Very High and Risk Impact $I$ is the product.
