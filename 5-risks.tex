\section{Risks} \label{risks}

To generate our risk register (Table \ref{table:risk_table}), as suggested in \cite{Dawson:2009:PCI:1611433} we use the equation: $I = L * C$,
where Likelihood \textbf{L} is classed according to three-point scale 
Low/Medium/High, Consequence \textbf{C} according to five-point
scale Very Low/Low/Medium/High/Very High and Risk Impact \textbf{I} is the product. We colour-coded the Impact column with RAG grading, and provide steps to mitigate each identified risk. The table is subject to change as the project progresses.
