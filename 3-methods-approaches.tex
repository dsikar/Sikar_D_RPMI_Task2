% \section{Approaches: Methods \& Tools for Design, Analysis \& Evaluation}
In this section we go over the steps shown in our work breakdown structure (Figure \ref{fig:workplan},

As far as approaches go, we blindly relied on \cite{Oates:2006}.

\subsection{Develop Models}

Paragraph 1 - \lipsum[10]
Paragraph 2 - \lipsum[11]

The models we are looking to develop are primarily the NVIDIA CNN model, followed by other convolutional neural network architectures, namely: GoogLeNet, ResNet, VGGNet, Bn-Inception and time allowing, a CNN and RNN (recurrent neural network).
