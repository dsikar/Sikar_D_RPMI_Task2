\textbf{Atkins}: Using the categories outlined by Oates (2006, p.16-21), I define the primary purposes of my
research paper as being to ‘add to the body of research’, ‘to solve a problem’ and to
‘contribute to personal needs’.

\textbf{Wells}: This project will be a “Design and Creation” type project as described by Oates [13]. The research
aspect is focussed on how the new technique of Infrastructure as Code can be applied to an existing
system design and the evaluation of the benefits that it brings.
