\section{Work Plan}

Our work plan consists of a work breakdown structure (Figure \ref{fig:workplan}) and a Gantt chart (Figure \ref{fig:gantt-chart}).
We identified 5 principal components, each successive component has a dependency on, and cannot start before, the previous component being completed, which represents a milestone.
